        "Adaptive Boost or AdaBoost has originated from Robert E. Schapire in 1990 [@schapire1990], [@mlbook2022], and was further introduced in 1996 by Robert Schapire and Yoav Freund at a conference which also led to a publication [@freund1997].\n",

        "\n",
        "During the process of running the algorithm, increased weights are given to the incorrectly predicted samples at each iteration, and less weights are given to the correctly predicted ones. This then forces the AdaBoost models to focus more on the less accurately predicted samples with the aim to improve ensemble performance. The predictions from these iterations are combined to produce a final prediction via a weighted majority vote style, which is a well-known signature of tree models. Overall, AdaBoost algorithm can be used for classification or regression problems. The main difference between bagging and boosting is that boosting only uses random subsets of training samples drawn from the training dataset without any replacements [@mlbook2022]. One caveat to note is that AdaBoost tend to overfit training data (high variance).\n",

However, some differences between these two types of boosted trees (e.g. AdaBoost and XGBoost) should be noted, and rather than describing them in a paragraph, I've summarised them in a table below."

        "This post is going to focus on Scikit_mol which has a manual way to handle SMILES errors, as shown in the code below. Another useful way to deal with SMILES errors is [Molpipeline](https://github.com/basf/MolPipeline)'s SMILES error handling, with an example shown in one of [its notebooks](https://github.com/basf/MolPipeline/blob/main/notebooks/03_error_handling.ipynb). The main difference from what I can see, even though I haven't got to use it yet, is that Molpipeline takes into account of all the invalid SMILES by giving each invalid SMILES a \"NaN\" label in the pipeline process - this maintains the matrix shape and good for tracking down the problematic SMILES (molecules)."

For example, *learning_rate* and *subsample* are the first two mentioned previously, and another technique is based on regularisation which includes two other parameters, *reg_alpha* (L1 regularisation based on Manhattan distance) and *reg_lamda* (L2 regularisation based on Euclidean distance). Both of these regularisation parameters aim to penalise XGBoost's model complexity to make it a bit more conservative in order to reduce overfitting [@bruce2020].\n",
