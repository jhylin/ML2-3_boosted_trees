*Planning stage*

Dataset 
- Biogen (ADMET data) 
- activity cliff paper
- ChEMBL via chembl_downloader with ?GPCR as target (very wide, need to narrow down)

*LightGBM*
Scikit-learn has built-in functions
* Histogram-based gradient boosting
- Mainly inspired by LightGBM
- Supports missing values and categorical data
- HistGradientBoostingClassifier() or regressor - best for sample size larger than tens of thousands
- GradientBoostingClassifier() or regressor - for small sample size e.g. less than tens of thousands

*XGBoost*
