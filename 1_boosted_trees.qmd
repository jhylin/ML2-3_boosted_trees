*Planning stage - Feb - Mar 2024*

*Datasets*
Options:
* ChEMBL via chembl_downloader with ?GPCR as target (very wide, need to narrow down)
- Biogen (ADMET data) or activity cliff paper


*LightGBM* (2nd post)
Scikit-learn has built-in functions
* Histogram-based gradient boosting
- Mainly inspired by LightGBM
- Supports missing values and categorical data
- HistGradientBoostingClassifier() or regressor - best for sample size > tens of thousands
- GradientBoostingClassifier() or regressor - for small sample size e.g. < tens of thousands


*XGBoost* (3rd post)
