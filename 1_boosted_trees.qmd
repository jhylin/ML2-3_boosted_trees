*Project timeline - Feb - May 2024*

*Datasets - ?searching for other ways of obtaining public drug discovery datasets*
Options:
- ChEMBL dataset obtained previously via chembl_downloader
- Biogen (ADMET data) or activity cliff paper

*LightGBM* 
* Developed by Microsoft

Scikit-learn has built-in functions
* Histogram-based gradient boosting
- Mainly inspired by LightGBM
- Supports missing values and categorical data
- HistGradientBoostingClassifier() or regressor - best for sample size > tens of thousands
- GradientBoostingClassifier() or regressor - for small sample size e.g. < tens of thousands
