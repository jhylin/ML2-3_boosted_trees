As promised earlier on, I was aiming to do a tree series that would include decision tree, random forests, and LightGBM and/or XGBoost. I've somewhat completed decision tree and random forests, so here we have boosted trees. 

This repository will hold most of the relevant files used on boosted trees.

For other work on decision tree and random forests (included classification and regression) - *provide links via blog*

Estimated time of completion for this work - hopefully within the 2nd quarter of 2024.
