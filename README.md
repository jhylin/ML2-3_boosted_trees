This repository will hold most of the relevant files used for boosted trees. I may remove the test notebooks in the near future as they may not be able to run logically from beginning till the end - I have only used small sections of them to test code etc. and it might be wise to remove them to avoid confusions.

Here's the link to [boosted trees](https://jhylin.github.io/Data_in_life_blog/posts/19_ML2-3_Boosted_trees/1_adaboost_xgb.html) which will make more sense than the Jupyter notebook version (some Quarto-specific layout formatting code in it, and apologies with the massive SMILES output in the print(X) cell... it won't look like this in the HTML webpage). 

For other work on tree models:
1. [Decision tree](https://jhylin.github.io/Data_in_life_blog/posts/16_ML2-1_Decision_tree/1_data_col_prep.html) (this is only the 1st post, with links provided at the beginning of the post that'll lead to 2nd and 3rd posts)
2. [Random forest (regressor)](https://jhylin.github.io/Data_in_life_blog/posts/17_ML2-2_Random_forest/1_random_forest.html)
3. [Random forest classifier](https://jhylin.github.io/Data_in_life_blog/posts/17_ML2-2_Random_forest/2_random_forest_classifier.html)
