This repository will hold most of the relevant files used on boosted trees.

Estimated time of completion for this work will hopefully be within the 2nd quarter of 2024, as I'm the sole worker for the tree series. At the minimum, I'm aiming to have at least one post on boosted trees done by mid-year.

For other work on decision tree and random forests (included classification and regression):
1. Decision tree - https://jhylin.github.io/Data_in_life_blog/posts/16_ML2-1_Decision_tree/1_data_col_prep.html (this is only the first post, with links provided at the beginning of the post that'll lead to second and third posts)
2. Random forest (regressor) - https://jhylin.github.io/Data_in_life_blog/posts/17_ML2-2_Random_forest/1_random_forest.html
3. Random forest (classifier) - https://jhylin.github.io/Data_in_life_blog/posts/17_ML2-2_Random_forest/2_random_forest_classifier.html
